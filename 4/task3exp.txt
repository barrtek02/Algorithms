In this part of the function, the code is generating all possible subsets of the input list by iterating over all binary numbers from 1 to 2^n-1 using the range function and bitwise operators. The range function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to 2^n-1, where n is the length of the input list. For each integer in the sequence, the bitwise operator & (AND) is used to check whether the jth bit (where j is the index of the element in the input list) is set to 1 or not. This is done by using the expression (i & (1 << j)) != 0. If the jth bit is set to 1, then the corresponding element in the input list is included in the subset.

For each generated subset, the sum function and a list comprehension are used to compute the sum of the elements in the subset. If the sum of the subset is equal to 0, the variable subset_sum0_value is set to True.

By iterating over all binary numbers from 1 to 2^n-1, the function is guaranteed to generate all possible non-empty subsets of the input list (since the binary number 0 represents the empty subset). Therefore, the function can determine whether there exists a non-empty subset of the input list whose sum is equal to 0.
